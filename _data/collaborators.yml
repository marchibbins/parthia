- name: Miika Vaso
  type: director
  about: "<p>Miika got his first taste of advertising working as a Creative at the tender age of 19 in Helsinki. He eventually escaped copywriting to study literature and film in Gothenburg and later graduating with a Masters from King's College London. During a successful and award-winning stint as an offline editor he traveled the world,editing in Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Cape Town, Buenos Aires, as well as the cold North. After reaching the British Airways silver level on air miles, he settled down to work as a Creative Producer at Fallon London, leading a team of editors and animators, producing and eventually directing digital content for clients ranging from Cadbury to Škoda. His multi-disciplinary approach to directing is influenced by his past roles and travels, stylistically developing a special fondness for the interplay between light and darkness. Apt for a man from Finland, perhaps.</p>"

- name: Roberto Duque
  type: director
  about: "<p>Roberto studied Fashion Promotion and Broadcast Journalism at The London College of Fashion.  It was here that he was first introduced to a camera and his love affair with directing and abstract storytelling began. After graduating, Roberto began working in Factual Entertainment Television as a Development Researcher.  After a year in development working alongside Steven D’Wright, Roberto landed a job at Google Creative Lab, where he created ideas for their branded video content division.</p><p>Eager to direct his own work, he funded his first directorial projects.
